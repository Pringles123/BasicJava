Here is my fourth session notes:

Session 4 notes:

Variables:
Variables are something that u can change its value.
x=3

Data Types:
The concept of variable is same in Java programming too, where a variable can change at any time.
Before discussing how we create variables in Java, let’s discuss following data.
   Q: What is your age?  
    A: 14
    Q: Which grade you are in? 
    A: 10

    Q: What is your name? 
    A: sairama
    Q: Which street you live in ? 
    A: Tucson

    Q: What is the price of bag?
    A: 24.50
    Q: What is 5/2?
    A: 2.5

    If you observe above data you can group them in 3 different categories
    (14,10)                   -> Numbers
    
    ("sairama", "Tucson")     -> Strings(series of alphabets)

    (24.50, 2.5)              -> Numbers with decimals

Syntax:
Syntax is the grammar for java

If statement:
In real life you get different paths based on certain conditions. For example if you are more than 15 years old, then you can get driver permit. If the day is Sunday or Saturday you don't have to go to school. In Java programming also you can conditions and do things only that conditions match. This is represented by if , else if and else statements.
  int age = 13;

   if( age > 15){
       System.out.println("you can get drivers permit");
   }else if( age == 15){
       System.out.println("Congratulations. today is the day where you can apply for permit.");
   }else{
       System.out.println("Sorry, please wait till you get 15");
   }
In above program the syntax is
  if( anything that evaluates to true/false){

   }else if(anything that evaluates to true/false){

   }else{
       // Anything does not match above.
   }

 
Looping(repetitions):
Just like we have some repetitions in real life, we have some repetitions in programming too. There are different ways of doing repetitions in programming. One example is;
For loop;
One such loop in Java programming is for loop. Before knowing syntax of for loop, lets take some real life scenario involving looping.
Lets say you are about to run in school playground tracks. You have been asked to run for 10 times on the track.
One time
Before starting the run and entering in to the track, you do some warm ups
Eat banana for instant energy
Put music and ear buds
Start counting your mind (still not finished one round,so you say yourself as zero)
Next
Check whether 10 rounds are done (you had zero runs so far, so you need to run on track)
Next
Start Run on track
After finishing one round
You add 1 to your run count which is 0+1 = 1
Then check whether you have finished 10 runs
As you have not reached 10 you will start run on track again.
You go for 2nd round
You add 1 to your run count which is 1+1 = 2
Then check whether you have finished 10 runs (only 2 runs )
As you have not reached 10 you will start run on track again.
You go for 3rd round .. so you repeat these ....
Now you are on run 9
You add 1 to your run count which is 9+1 = 10
Then check whether you have finished 10 runs
Yes you are done
Stop running at this time.
Lets see how we can do this in Java programming
  int i;  // For counting in loops usually variable name 'i' is used 

   for(i=0 ; i<10 ; i++){
       System.out.println("running :" + (i+1));
   }

The above program will print running statement as 10 times.
Lets the syntax of for loop
  for( initialiation_onetime ; condition_which_should_return_true_or_false ; do_some_increment_which_runs_for_each_loop){
       somestatements_which_will_execute_aslongas_theconditionis_true
   }
Lets see how computer runs the above for program
Step-1 (only one time)
i=0
Step-2
i < 10 ( is 0<10, yes true)
Step-3
System.out.println("running " + (i+1)) ( prints "running 1)
Step-4
i=i+1 ( i will become 1)
Step-5
i<10 ( is 1<10 , yes true)
Step-6
System.out.println("running " + (i+1)) (prints "running 2")
...
...
...
Finally when i becomes 10 and the condition 10<10 becomes false and thats where the loop stops.
so if you observe the 3 parts in for loop are
initialiation -> one time
condition_which_should_return_true_or_false -> each loop time
do_some_increment_which_runs_for_each_loop -> each loop time.

Naming of variables:
When naming variables in Java programming, it is best practice give proper good names for easy understanding and readability of the code.
some bad examples;
  int x;
   String y;
   double z;
some good examples;
  int age;
   String name;
   double price;
Commenting:
One can put comments in the code . if you start the line with // and anything followed by is comment and good practice to put your notes in the code
  // This loop prints up to 100 numbers.

Indentation:
While editing the program indentation (meaning putting spaces or tabs in section of the code) is important for readability and identifying any mistakes in the code (yes indentation helps readability and hence spotting any errors easily).
*Hint: Use Ctrl+Shift+F (on Windows and on mac Ctrl->Command) to do auto indent which indent properly.
Fixing Syntax errors:
Remember syntax is grammar and if you don't follow proper grammar then Java program will complain. Eclipse which is IDE ( Interactive Development Environment ) for Java projects shows a small red circle showing some error. One can click that red circle to see what is the actual error and fix them.


Matching curly brackets ( { } ):
In Java a block is defined between two curly brackets which starts with { and ends with }. It is important to match them , i.e every open { should have }. If not you will get error
