Here are my session 13 notes:

Recap:
- We have learned about Constructor
- Constructor will allow to create object with some starting values.
- We will revisit once again Constructor after going through some methods.

Steps for writing method signature:

1)First you have to ask for method name
In above these 
	doHomeWork
	readBook
2)Then you have to ask for what is inputs 
	for doHomeWork there are no inputs
	for readBook there is one input called bookName and then you have to ask for what is its data type
3)Then you have to ask for what it gives back 
	for doHomeWork there is no output
for readBook the output is number of minutes read. Now we are ready to write the method signature
method name
    doHomeWork
    readBook
Write open and close parenthesis
    doHomeWork()
    readBook()
Write open { and close }
    doHomeWork(){

    }

    readBook(){

    }
Write any inputs in parenthesis. If no inputs then no need to write anything
    doHomeWork(){

    }

    readBook(String bookName){

    }
Write output data type (here it is the data type and not the variable). If it is not returning anything then you have to write void
    void doHomeWork(){

    }

    int readBook(String bookName){

    }
Write a return statement which matches with data type .
    void doHomeWork(){
            // No return statement here.
    }

    int readBook(String bookName){

        return 10;      // The value returned (10 here) should match with data type(int here) mentioned.
    }

Now complete the logic if any in the method

Constructor revisited:

We have seen constructor earlier. Lets revisit one more time as we have learned about methods.
A constructor is
method ( it has inputs just like any other method)
special method 
Its name is same as class type
It does not have return data type ( you cannot say void also);
