Here is my first session notes
What is a Computer?
A computer = hardware + software

Hardware:
Things you can touch/feel (some you can see outside and some are inside which needs to open the case)
Some examples Mouse, keyboard( can be seen) , CPU,Motherboard,Hard disk(need to open the cover)

CPU:
Central, Proccessing, Unit
The computer’s brain

RAM:
The RAM is like scratch pad where things can be done temporarily to do some stuff and can be thrown away.

Hard disk:
The memory of the computer
The hard disk is used to save information permanently so that even if the computer is shutdown we will have things saved.

Software:
A software is a program.
Apps are softwares
There are many types of softwares and each software does something special, for e.g:
youtube(used to watch videos and content), word(used to write papers), PowerPoint(used to make slideshows), etc.
For each software a certain program is written, a program is a series of ; steps, actions, and instructions( instructions is the correct terminology)
Some examples:
	- Read(instruction: read)
	- Read book for 10 mins ( instruction: read, data; 10 mins)
	- Run for 1 hour at 6miles/hour (instructions: run, data; 1 hour,  6miles/hour)



Binary:
Binary is a different number system where you have only two choices which are either 1 or 0 (only 2 numbers you can use) and base is 2 (instead of 10 as in decimal).
To convert binary to decimal
expand each digit with its place value and base 2
The place values goes multiple of 2 ( in decimal it is multiple of 10)
1, 2 , 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and so on
for example given: 11100111 will be
(1 * 2^7) + (1 * 2^6) + (1 * 2^5) + (0 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) +(1 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0)
128+64+32+0+0+4+2+1
231

To convert decimal to binary
split the number in multiple of 2
for ex: 83
64+16+2+1
remember in binary place values are multiple of 2
in above we have missing 4, 8, 32 means it will be zero in the place
start from last number
1 is mean 1 ( 1)
2 means second place 1 ( 11 )
4 missing meaning third place 0 ( 011 )
8 missing meaning fourth place 0 ( 0011 )
16 means fifth place 1 ( 10011)
32 missing means 6th place 0 ( 010011)
64 means 7th place 1 ( 1010011)
1010011
